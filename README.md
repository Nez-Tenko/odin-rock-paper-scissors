# odin-rock-paper-scissors

In this project I wrote a simple rock, paper, scissors game. The user will be prompted to input either: rock, paper, or scissors (case-insensitive, although you must spell them correctly), and the computer will "randomly" choose either: rock, paper, or scissors as well. Five rounds will be played, with the program keeping track of both the player's and computer's score. The one with the highest score wins. To play this game (and see if you win or lose), you must open the console using your web browser's developer tools.
